the Command lind utility excepts if the following way

1. image file path - the name of the file we want to put the whole in
2. mask file path - the name of the file we will create a mask using
3. z - the z we want to work with
4. epsilon - the epsilon we want to work with
5. Connection type - a number we want to represent our connection type with

=======================

1.
given that there are m boundary and n points within the whole
for each whole we must calculate the color of the whole by going over every pixel in the border
and get its weight compared to the current hole pixel (assuming the action of
getting the weight is O(1) for every input of the two points)
and fill the pixel back with the correct color  we get that the total runtime of
this action would be O(n * m)
at most each whole n could have cn border pixels (where c represents the connection type)
(but the bigger the whole gets and the more round it gets it goes towards log(n))
therefore at most it would be O(n * cn) = O(cn^2) = O(n^2)

2.
assuming that we are dealing with a single whole and the pixels are not too far away from each other
all we do would be approximate a single whole in the center of our whole
get the weight color based upon the given weight function at that point
and fill the rest of the holes with the given approximation color
finding the center whole could be O(n) approximating the color
it would be cn (as explained above) filling the rest
of the whole would be O(n) giving us a total of O(n + cn + n) = O(n)
